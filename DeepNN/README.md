### Lab Structure
1. Start with `DeepNNs.ipynb` to ensure you understand what neural networks do and their motivation and run the code there to compare LogisticRegression from last tutorial (`Neuron.py`) with a full neural network we build in (`Torch.py`). You donâ€™t need to understand `Torch.py` for now as you are about to implement it from scratch.
2. Afterwards go to `Backprop.ipynb` and make sure you understand the notation of the equations and the backprpagation algorithm and its class structure
3. Go to implement `Backprop.py` which has 15 TODOs
4. Go back to `Backprop.ipynb` to test your network and perform analysis on various selections of hyperparameters
