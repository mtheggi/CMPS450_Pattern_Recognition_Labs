### Lab Structure
- There are eight todos in each of PCA.py and Adaboost.py
- Then some more minor todos in PCA.ipynb and Adaboost.ipynb (e.g., calling the constructor or generating data)
- No todos in Wafer.ipynb
- There are engineering questions in each of Adaboost.ipynb, PCA.ipynb, Wafer.ipynb
- As usual the recommended order is to read the lab introductions in the PCA/Adaboost notebooks, jump into the PCA/Adaboost .py files to implement, go back to the notebooks to test and analyze and then go to the real-life application in Wafer.ipynb
